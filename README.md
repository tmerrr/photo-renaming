Rename pictures from my old iPhone backup and move to a new folder

I had an old folder of pictures, backed up from my iPhone.
All images had the format IMG_1234.JPG

Task was to create a program which selected a range of pictures from the old folder, based on their number,
then move them to either an existing or new folder and rename each picture.
